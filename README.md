# Welcome to my Android building guide for junior developers

After 2 years of building ROMs i think i can do a basic guide to help people about the Android building procces.
This guide will explain basic steps like how to search, adapt device trees and the build procces.
We will use LineageOS as base cuz itÂ´s more easly to start.

## 0. Requeriments

 * amd64[x86_64] machine with 6 cores or more [probably u may can be able to build with 4 but not recommended at all}
 * Linux operating system [we will use Ubuntu based]
 * 500GB Hard drive [SSD/NVMe recommended]
 * 16GB of RAM [this depends of the android version but we recommend 32GB to avoid problems]
 * A good network speed [To download sources without problems]
 * A brain
